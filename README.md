<h1>Capstone Project: IDENTIFICATION OF QUORA QUESTION PAIRS</h1>

<h3>ABSTRACT:</h3>
This project aims to improve the user experience on Quora by identifying duplicate
question pairs. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL)
algorithms, we classify whether questions share the same intent. With a dataset of over
400,000 labeled question pairs, we train and evaluate models to optimize the process of
seeking and providing high-quality answers on Quora.

<h3>OBJECTIVES:</h3>
● To utilize NLP and DL algorithms to extract semantic meaning from question pairs.
<br>● To develop a model capable of classifying if pairs of questions on Quora have the same intent are duplicate.
<br>● To test the data across multiple models and identify the effective model.
<br>● To optimize the model's performance to achieve a high accuracy in identifying duplicate question pairs
