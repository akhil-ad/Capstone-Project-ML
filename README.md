**Title:** Identification of Quora Question Pairs

**Description:**

This project focuses on enhancing the Quora user experience by identifying duplicate question pairs. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, we aim to accurately classify whether two questions convey the same intent. Our dataset, comprising over 400,000 labeled question pairs, serves as the foundation for training and evaluating various models, ultimately optimizing the process of finding and delivering relevant answers on Quora.

**Key Objectives:**

* **To utilize NLP and DL algorithms to extract semantic meaning from question pairs.**
* **To develop a model capable of classifying if pairs of questions on Quora have the
same intent are duplicate.**
* **To test the data across multiple models and identify the effective model.**
* **To optimize the model's performance to achieve a high accuracy in identifying
duplicate question pairs.**
